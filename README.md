node-apt-get
============

apt-get wrappers for node js designed for automatic upgrade driven by node.
Does not currently implement install / remove / purge because they are of no use to me. However feel free to submit a pull request for it.

Tests are only localized in french. You're welcome to provide other locale's results to test them.
